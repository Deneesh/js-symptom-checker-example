# Symptom Checker Example

This is an example symptom checker written in pure ES6 (without using any frameworks).

We created it to help you work with our API, and show you how to implement such application on your own.
This application mimics doctor's interview and gives you a diagnosis basing on our mathematical model.

The most recent API documentation is always available on our [developer portal.](https://developer.infermedica.com/)

Do not hesitate to contact us if you need any further help.

## Dependencies

Before going to the next step, please make sure that you have `node` installed in your system.
Please refer to the docs to find out the most suitable way depending on your OS.

This project uses `yarn` as dependency manager. Please make sure that you have `yarn` installed before going to the next step.

`# npm install -g yarn`

Next steps assume that you have installed all dependencies. 

## Getting started

### Installing further dependencies with yarn

Please go to the root directory and type
`yarn install`.

### Running the app in development mode

`yarn dev`

### Preparing a production-ready build

`yarn build`

## Plans for the future

* we plan to extract `infermedica-api.js` from this example and release it as standalone ES6 module
* it may be worth to use JSX templates
